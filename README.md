# Jamcloud-client
Jamcloud allows users to keep track of 
the various live recordings that their 
favorite artists have performed. With so
 many vastly different versions of the 
 same song it can be near impossible to 
 remember which versions stick out. Writing
  them down on paper doesn't fully solve the
   problem as you will end up with a list that 
   is hard to search through and potentially plagued 
    with duplicates and errors.
